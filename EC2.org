* ec2(elastic compute cloud)
  - is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud.
    amazon ec2 reduces the time required to obtain and boot new server instances
    to minutes, allowing you to quickly scale capacity, both up and down, as
    your computing requirements change.

** ec2 options
   - [[on demand]]: allow you to pay fixed rate by the hour with no commitment.
   - [[reserved]]: provide you with a capacity reservation, and offer a significant
     discount on the hourly charge for an instance. 1 year or 3 years tem.
   - [[spot]]: enable you to bid whatever price you want for instance capacity,
     providing for even greater savings if your applications have flexible start
     and end time.
   - [[Dedicated Hosts]]: Physical EC2 server dedicated for your use. Dedicated Hosts
     can help you reduce costs by allowing you to use your existing server-bound
     software licenses.

*** On Demand <<on demand>>
    - Users thar want the low cost and flexibility of Amazon EC2 without any
      up-front payment or long-term commitment.
    - Applications with short term, spiky, or unpredictable workloads that cannot
      be interrupted.
    - Applications being developedor tested on Amazon EC2 for the first time.

*** Reserved <<reserved>>
   - Applications with steady state or predictable usage.
   - Applications that require reserved capacity.
   - Users able to make upfront payments to reduce their total computing costs
     even further.

*** Spot <<spot>>
    - Applications that have flexible start and end times.
    - Applications that are only feasible at very low compute prices.
    - Users with urgent computing needs for large amounts of additional capacity.

*** Dedicated Hosts <<dedicated hosts>>
    - Useful for reqgulatory requirements that may not support multi-tenant
      virtualization.
    - Great for licensing which does not support multi-tenancy or cloud
      deployments i.e SQL server License for only physical hardware.
    - Can be purchased On-Demand (hourly).
    - Can be purchased as a Reservation for up to 70% off the On-Demand price.

** EBS
   - Amazon EBS allows you to create storage volumes and attach them to Amazon EC2
     instances. Once attached, you can create a file system on top of these volumes,
     run a database, or use them in any other way you would use a block device.
     Amazon EBS volumes are placed in a specific Availability Zone, where they are
     automatically replicated to protect you from the failure of a single component.

** Security Groups
   - Any rule you make to a security group applies inmediately.
   - All Inbound traffic is blocked by default.
   - You can have any number of EC2 instances within a security group.
   - You can have multiple security groups attached to EC2 Instances.
   - Security Groups are STATEFUL.
     * If you create an inbound rulle allowing traffic inm that traffic is
       automatically allowed back out again.
   - You cannot block specific IP addresses using Security Groups, instead use
     Network Access Control Lists.
   - You can specify allow rules, but not deny rules.


*** EBS Volume Types
    - General Purpose SSD(Gp2):
      * General purpose, balances both price and performance.
      * Ratio of 3 IOPS per GB with up to 10,000 IOPS and the ability to burst up
        to 3000 IOPS for extended periods of time for volumes under 1Gib.
    - Provisioned IOPS SSD(IO1):
      * Designed for I/O intensive applications such as large relational or NoSQL
        databases.
      * Use if you need more than 10000 IOPS.
      * Can provision up to 20000 IOPS per volume.
    - Throughput Optimized HDD(ST1) -> Magnetic Storage:
      * Big data.
      * Data warehouses.
      * Log processing.
      * Then can't be boot volumes, you can't boot from these particular drives.
    - Cold HDD(SC1):
      * Lowest Cost Storage for infrequently accessed workloads.
      * File Server.
      * Cannot be a boot volume.
    - Magnetic(Standard):
      * Lowest cost per gigabyte of all EBS volume typesthat is bootable. Magnetic
        volumes are ideal for workloads where data is accessed infrequently, and
        applications where the lowest storage cost is important.
      * It's booteable.

**** Exam Tips
     - Spot Prices: If the spot instance is terminated by Amazon EC2, you will not
       be charged for a partial hour of usage. However, if you terminate the
       instance by yourself, you wil be charged for any hour in which the instance
       ran.
     - Know the difference between:
       * On demand.
       * Sport.
       * Reserved.
       * Dedicated Hosts.
     - Remember with spot instances:
       * If you terminate the insurance, you pay for the hour.
       * If AWS terminates the spot instance, you get the hour it was terminated
         for free.
     - EBS Consists of:
       * SSD, Gernal purpose-GP2-(Up to 10000 IOPS).
       * SSD, Provisioned IOPS-IO1-(More than 10000 IOPS).
       * HDD, Throughput Optimized-ST1 frequently access workloads.
       * HDD, Cold-SC1- less frequently accessed data. Ideal for File Servers for example
       * HDD magnetic - Standard- cheap, infrequently accessed storage(bootable).
     - You cannot mount 1 EBS volume to multiple EC2 instances, instead use EFS.
     - Remember all EC2 Instances types.
     - Termination protection is turned off by default.
     - On an EBS-backed instance, the default acion is for the root EBS volume to
       be deleted when the instance is terminated.
     - EBS Root Volumes of your DEFAULT AMI's cannot be encrypted. You can also
       use a third party tool(such as bit locker etc) to encrypt the root volume,
       or this can be done when creating AMI's in the AWS console or using the API.
     - Additional volumes fo your DEFAULT AMI's can be encrypted(not root volumes).
