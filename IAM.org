* Identity Access Management(IAM)

IAM allows you to manage users and their level of access to the AWS Console.

** What does IAM give you?
   - Centralised control of your AWS account.
   - Shared access to your AWS account.
   - Granular Permissions.
   - Identity Federation(including Active Directory, Facebook, Linkedin, etc).
   - Multifactor Authentication.
   - Provide temporary access for users/devices and services where necessary.
   - Allows you to set up your own password rotation policy.
   - Integrates with many different AWS services.
   - Supports PCI DSS Compliance.

** IAM consists on:
   - Users
   - Groups(A way to group users and apply polices to them collectively).
   - Roles.
   - Policy Documents(json of the polices).

** Notes
   - IAM is universal. It doesn't apply to regions.
   - The "root account" is simply te account created when first setup your AWS account.
     It has complete Admin access.
   - New Users have NO permissions when first created.
   - New Users are assigned Access Key ID & Secret Access Keys when first created.
   - These are no the same as a password, and you cannot use the Access Key to Login in to the console.
     You can use this to access AWS via the APIs and Command Line however.
   - You only get to view these once. If you lose them, you have to regenerate them.
   - Always setup Multifactor Authentication on your root account.
   - You can create and customize your own password rotation polices.
